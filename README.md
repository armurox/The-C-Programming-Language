# The C Programming Language
Hello! Welcome to this repository. This contains my work as I read through the second edition of **The C Programming Language** by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. This repo is intended as a way for me to keep in touch with C, and also attempt to seriously study the language and many of its features. While I have a some prior experience wih the language (it being my first language in which I began somewhat seriously programming), this is my way to try and truly familiarize myself with it. This README will grow as I work through the book, and you can expect, at the very least, all the code examples in the book to be here. Additionally, I may include my thoughts at the end of each chapter, and also interesting other projects and pieces of C code I would have written while experimenting with the language.
